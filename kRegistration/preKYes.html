Since your student already has an RSU 71 enrollment you will use our Parent Portal to register your student for Kindergarten. <br>
We already have you in our system so the application will pull all of your existing information, saving  you time.
<ul>
	<li>If you have other students in RSU 71 you may register them as well.</li>
	<li>You can complete all students in your household in a single application - there is no need to create one for each person.</li>
</ul>
<p> Access the Parent Portal here: <p><a href="https://rsu71.infinitecampus.org/campus/portal/parents/rsu71.jsp">RSU 71 Parent Portal</a></p>
<ul>
Once logged in 
<li>click More(or the 3 bars at the top left if you do not see the More link)</li>
<li> Annual Student Update</li>
<li> Use the EXISTING Student Option - for 2023-2024 School Year.
